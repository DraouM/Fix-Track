This is a NextJS starter in Firebase Studio.

To get started, take a look at src/app/page.tsx.

## Tech Stack

This project is built with a modern and robust set of technologies:

*   **Next.js:** A React framework for building full-stack web applications. It handles routing, server-side rendering, static site generation, and more.
*   **React:** A JavaScript library for building user interfaces with a component-based architecture.
*   **TypeScript:** A typed superset of JavaScript that enhances code quality, maintainability, and developer experience by adding static types.
*   **ShadCN UI:** A collection of beautifully designed, accessible, and customizable UI components built on Radix UI and Tailwind CSS. These are not a traditional component library but rather copy-pasteable components you own.
*   **Tailwind CSS:** A utility-first CSS framework for rapidly building custom designs directly in your markup. It provides low-level utility classes to build any design without writing custom CSS.
*   **Genkit:** An open-source framework by Google for building AI-powered features. It helps orchestrate calls to language models (like Gemini), manage prompts, and structure AI flows.
*   **Lucide React:** A comprehensive library of simply beautiful and consistent open-source icons.
*   **Zod:** A TypeScript-first schema declaration and validation library. It's used for validating data structures, especially form inputs and API responses.
*   **React Hook Form:** A performant, flexible, and extensible library for managing forms in React. It integrates well with Zod for validation.
*   **Recharts:** A composable charting library built on React components, used for creating various types of data visualizations like bar, line, and pie charts.

This stack is chosen for its strong Vercel and Google Cloud integration, developer productivity, performance, and scalability.
